A Collection of my Projects

I am very passionate about coding and seek to furthur my skills in this field. I have made my first project that is still a work in progress. 
This repository will serve as a place I can share my passion for coding or programming.

project 1 (Jungle Survival) : The ultimate goal of this project is going to be to spawn multiple spiders as time increases. Once a certain number of spiders appear and time runs
out the player will win.
