Jungle Survivor

Intermediate python project (Jungle Survival) : The ultimate goal of this project is going to be to spawn multiple spiders as time increases. Once a certain number of spiders appear and time runs out the player will win. The most challenging part, so far, was making the character jump, but, through countless tutorials and some of my own understanding of physics, specifically the path of a parabolas, I solved my problem.
