A Collection of my Projects

This repository will serve as a place where I can share my passion for coding or programming and seek to furthur my skills in this field. By this point, I have made my first project, that is still a work in progress. 

project 1 (Jungle Survival) : The ultimate goal of this project is going to be to spawn multiple spiders as time increases. Once a certain number of spiders appear and time runs out the player will win. The most challenging part was making the character jump, but, through countless tutorials and some of my own understanding of physics
I solved my problem.
